> **"The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now."** - Chinese Proverb

## 🎯 What is Motivation App?

Motivation App is a scientifically-backed gratitude and mindfulness application designed to help users cultivate positive thinking and improve their mental well-being through a simple, daily ritual. Inspired by years of research in positive psychology, particularly the groundbreaking work of Martin Seligman and his "Three Good Things" exercise.

## ✨ Why Motivation App?

- **3 minutes daily** can reduce stress by up to 60%
- **Effects last up to 6 months** with consistent practice
